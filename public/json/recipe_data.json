TIP: The rectangles will be perforated\u2014keep them together as best you can. \u2022 Using a rolling pin, roll each dough rectangle until \u215b inch thick, pinching the diagonal seam together and rolling over it to seal.\n\u2022 Pat salmon* dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. \u2022 Using the back of a spoon, evenly spread Dijon over dough rectangles. Place salmon horizontally, skin sides up, in the center of each rectangle. \u2022 Carefully fold top and bottom edges of dough over salmon, leaving ends open.\n\u2022 Once carrots have roasted 10 minutes, remove sheet from oven. Lightly coat seam sides of wrapped salmon with oil (a pastry brush works great here!). \u2022 Place wrapped salmon, seam sides down and at least 2 inches apart, on opposite side of baking sheet.

Add chicken in a single layer; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.\n\u2022 Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together Caesar dressing, mayonnaise, oregano, 1 TBSP olive oil, \u00bd tsp Italian Seasoning, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a pinch of salt and pepper (2 TBSP olive oil, 1 tsp Italian Seasoning, and a big squeeze of lemon juice for 4 servings).

TIP: Don\u2019t skip this step\u2014 massaging helps the kale leaves wilt slightly, lending a tender (never fibrous!) texture.\n\u2022 To bowl with kale, add half the creamy Caesar dressing; toss to coat. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired.\n\u2022 Wrap tortillas in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, 30 seconds.\n\u2022 Place tortillas on a clean work surface. Spread remaining creamy Caesar dressing across bottom third of each tortilla. Top with chicken, tomato, half the Parmesan, and as much kale salad as you like (be sure to reserve some salad for serving!). \u2022 Fold up bottom side of each tortilla over filling, then fold over left and right sides toward filling. Roll up tortillas, starting with filled sides, to form wraps.\n\u2022 Halve wraps on a diagonal; divide wraps and remaining kale salad between plates. Garnish salad with remaining Parmesan and serve.

Roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until chickpeas are slightly crispy, 18-20 minutes. (It\u2019s natural for chickpeas to pop a bit while roasting.) \u2022 Wipe out bowl.\n\u2022 While chickpeas roast, heat a large drizzle of oil in a small pot (use a medium pot for 4 servings) over medium-high heat.

Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve. While the rice cooks, pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board.\n\u2022 Quarter cucumber lengthwise; slice into \u00bd-inch-thick pieces. Halve tomatoes lengthwise. Zest and quarter lemon. \u2022 In bowl used for chickpeas, combine cucumber, tomatoes, and as much sliced shallot as you like. Toss with half the lemon zest, juice from one lemon wedge, and a drizzle of olive oil. (For 4 servings, use juice from two wedges and a large drizzle of olive oil.)

Wash and dry produce. \u2022 Drain and rinse chickpeas; dry thoroughly with paper towels, removing as much moisture as possible. Halve, peel, and thinly slice shallot; mince a few slices until you have 2 TBSP (4 TBSP for 4 servings). Peel and mince or grate garlic. Roughly chop pistachios.\n\u2022 In a medium bowl, toss chickpeas with half the stock concentrates, half the Shawarma Spice Blend (you\u2019ll use the rest in the next step), a large drizzle of oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper. \u2022 Spread chickpeas out in a single layer on a lightly oiled foil-lined baking sheet. Roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until chickpeas are slightly crispy, 18-20 minutes. (It\u2019s natural for chickpeas to pop a bit while roasting.) \u2022 Wipe out bowl.\n\u2022 While chickpeas roast, heat a large drizzle of oil in a small pot (use a medium pot for 4 servings) over medium-high heat.

(Save basmati rice for another use.)\n\u2022 Quarter cucumber lengthwise; slice into \u00bd-inch-thick pieces. Halve tomatoes lengthwise. Zest and quarter lemon. \u2022 In bowl used for chickpeas, combine cucumber, tomatoes, and as much sliced shallot as you like. Toss with half the lemon zest, juice from one lemon wedge, and a drizzle of olive oil. (For 4 servings, use juice from two wedges and a large drizzle of olive oil.) Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\u2022 In a small bowl, whisk together vegan mayo, remaining garlic, remaining lemon zest, and juice from one lemon wedge (two wedges for 4 servings). \u2022 Whisk in 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4) until combined. (If needed, add water 1 tsp at a time until sauce reaches a drizzling consistency.) Season white sauce with salt and pepper to taste.\n\u2022 Fluff rice with a fork.

Using a rubber spatula, add bean mixture mounds to pan and gently press to flatten into patties, each about as wide as a burger bun. \u2022 Cook until golden brown and crisp, 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer patties to a plate. TIP: Depending on the size of your pan, you may need to work in batches, adding another drizzle of oil before each batch.\n\u2022 Halve and toast buns until golden; spread cut sides with 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings).

Halve, core, and thinly slice bell pepper into strips.\n\u2022 Toss carrots on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of oil, 1 tsp Shawarma Spice Blend (2 tsp for 4 servings), salt, and pepper. \u2022 Toss chickpeas on one side of a second sheet with a large drizzle of oil, 1 tsp Shawarma Spice Blend (2 tsp for 4), salt, and pepper. (Be sure to measure the Shawarma Spice Blend\u2014we sent more.) \u2022 Toss bell pepper on empty side with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper.\n\u2022 Roast carrots on middle rack and chickpeas and bell pepper on top rack until veggies are browned and tender and chickpeas are crispy, 18-22 minutes. TIP: Check on your veggies and chickpeas after 18 minutes; if carrots finish first, remove from oven and set aside.\n\u2022 Meanwhile, halve, peel, and thinly slice half the onion (save the rest for another use). Quarter lemon. Finely chop cilantro. \u2022 In a small bowl, combine onion, juice from two lemon wedges, a pinch of sugar, and salt. Set aside to pickle. \u2022 In a separate small bowl, combine yogurt, sour cream, \u00bc tsp garlic powder (\u00bd tsp for 4 servings), a squeeze of lemon juice, and as much harissa powder as you like. (You\u2019ll use the rest of the garlic powder in the next step.) Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper.\n\u2022 Melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add couscous and cook, stirring, until lightly toasted, 2-3 minutes. \u2022 Add stock concentrate, \u00be cup water (1\u00bd cups for 4), remaining garlic powder, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until couscous is tender, 6-8 minutes. Keep covered off heat. While couscous cooks, pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook until browned and cooked through, 3-5 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board to rest.\n\u2022 Once veggies and chickpeas are done, stir apricots into couscous; season with salt and pepper. \u2022 Divide couscous between bowls; arrange chickpeas, bell pepper, and carrots on top in separate sections. Drizzle with yogurt sauce. Top with cilantro and as much pickled onion (draining first) as you like. Serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side. Slice chicken crosswise; serve atop bowls. Chicken is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165\u00b0.",
